Bjarne Stroustrup (1994) The Design and Evolution of C++.
Addison-Wesley; Reading, Mass. ISBN:0201543303

I have read (2022) part of this book.

Why I started reading this book (nearly) 30-year-old computer
language book in 2022:

              "[Today's C++] looks remarkably like
                  [what is described in] D&E."

                  ---Bjarne Stroustrup [2021]

Bjarne Stroustrup also had this to say about D&E in [2021]:

        "[As] C++ started to [become] polular... a lot of
        people [were] explaining it to a lot of other
        people what it was and what it wasn't and they
        were getting it wrong quite consistently....

        "I wrote The Design and Evolution of C++, the
        purpose being to explain what C++ is, why [it is
        the way it is], and what the ideas are [because]
        I realized that articulation of... ideas is
        absolutely essential [as opposed to] saying to
        people, 'this is what you can do...' [and
        leaving out an explanaiton of] why... it
        make[s] sense to do it that way..."
